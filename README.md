# Yet_Another_Habit_Tracking_App
I'm trying to develop a hobby project. A simple 100 Day coding challenge for consistency and learning things along the way.

# Habit Challenge App (Python-First)

A social habit-tracking and challenge platform built entirely with Python.

This project is part of a **100-day challenge** to design, build, and deploy a real-world application using AI assistance while maintaining strong engineering discipline.

---

## Core Idea

The application allows users to:

- Create habits and challenges
- Invite friends or participate publicly
- Track daily progress
- Vote on incomplete tasks (community accountability)
- Earn or lose points based on honesty and consistency
- Compete via leaderboards (no money, no RPG mechanics)

The system prioritizes **transparency, fairness, and social pressure** rather than gamified health bars.

---

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- Python 3.11+
- FastAPI
- SQLAlchemy (async)
- PostgreSQL
- Alembic (migrations)
- Redis (leaderboards & caching)

### Clients
- Web (FastAPI + templating initially)
- Android (Kivy – planned)
- iOS (planned later)

---

## Project Status

🚧 **Active Development**

Current phase:
- Database schema design
- SQLAlchemy models
- Migration setup

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <repo-name>
